The Temperature Service Layer is composed of two packages.
  * A Data Layer interface and implementation using Linq to XML
  * A Web layer exposing the temperature data from the Data Layer from a different domain, through SOAP
==Data Layer==
The National Climatic Data Service provides a [http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/CDO/wmores40.jsp?page=http://www7.ncdc.noaa.gov/CDO/cdoselect.cmd?datasetabbv=GSOD%26countryabbv=%26georegionabbv= web interface] to download climate data in various formats.
An [NCDCXmlFormat XML file] of daily high and low temperatures for Lambert-St. Louis International Airport for an arbitrary period provides the data for the sample application.
Using the contract-first pattern, an XSD schema was used to generate the types used by the Service Layer and the types were generated using the xsd.exe tool.
