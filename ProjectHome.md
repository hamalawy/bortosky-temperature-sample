# Gary Bortosky's code demonstration #

Thanks for visiting my technology demonstration site. This project is intended for me to maintain and renew my skills inventory and experiment with and demonstrate various Microsoft and other technologies.  I'll use a simple temperature application to do so.

Please see http://www.bortosky.com/samples/temperature/googletimeline.aspx for the completed project.

## Components ##
  * [Service Layer](ServiceLayer.md)
  * [Web Client Layer](WebClientLayer.md)
  * [Silverlight Access](SilverlightTemps.md)
